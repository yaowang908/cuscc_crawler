  	As China&#39;s environmental woes increasingly seep into citizens&#39; daily lives, a new collective consciousness is taking form and people are looking for change.

  	&quot;In the past two years alone, there&#39;s been a lot of public outcry on the high pollution levels in cities all across China,&quot; said Merisha Enoe, senior research analyst with the China Greentech Initiative.

  	Following the &quot;airpocalypse&quot; that enshrouded vast pockets of the nation in a toxic cloud this past January and February, Enoe said people took to Weibo - China&#39;s Twitter equivalent - demanding the government take action.

  	Now the government requires 74 cities in China to publish their PM2.5 readings, which help measure air pollution.

  	&quot;In 2008, there were no greentech projects,&quot; said Elle Carberry, co-founder and managing director of the China Greentech Initiative. &quot;Now, there is potential for projects, and it has to do with the greater public awareness and greater government policies to enable that.&quot;

  	Last week, Carberry and Enoe flew to New York from Beijing to present their findings in the China Greentech Report 2013: China at a Crossroads at the China Institute. Carberry will also present the report with a panel of environmental experts in Chicago on July 10.

  	&quot;[In this year&#39;s report], our key finding is the top-down mandates and policies of the [Chinese] government is not enough,&quot; Carberry said in her presentation. &quot;The government has outgrown the ability to mandate its economy and now it has to let the market get up and take over.&quot;

  	The six-year-old Beijing-based China Greentech Initiative is not an NGO, but a private business of 27 employees who are collaborating with about 1,000 experts and 100 organizations, businesses and government groups to take on China&#39;s environmental issues and seize on commercial opportunities to improve citizens&#39; quality of living.

  	The group conducts about 15 collaborative meetings annually to take on specific sectors one at a time, such as industrial wastewater treatment, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, green building materials, renewable energies, or urban transportation.

  	&quot;We work together with companies to integrate solutions and now we&#39;re working on divvying up the projects for actual deployment,&quot; Carberry said. &quot;We want to find where exactly are the best cities in the country that are serious about growing their city economically, but on a cleaner, greener footprint.&quot;
