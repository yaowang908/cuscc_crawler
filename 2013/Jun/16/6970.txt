CUCCBRC EB-5 Program\n\n

  	The EB-5 visa for Immigrant Investors is a United States visa created by the Immigration Act of 1990. This visa provides a method of obtaining agreen card for foreign nationals who invest money in the United States. To obtain the visa, individuals must invest $1,000,000 (or at least $500,000 in a &quot;Targeted Employment Area&quot; - high unemployment or rural area), creating or preserving at least 10 jobs for U.S. workers excluding the investor and their immediate family. Initially, under the first EB-5 program, the foreign investor was required to create an entirely new commercial enterprise; however, under the Pilot Program investments can be made directly in a job-generating commercial enterprise (new, or existing - &quot;Troubled Business&quot;), or into a &quot;Regional Center&quot; - a 3rd party-managed investment vehicle (private or public), which assumes the responsibility of creating the requisite jobs. Regional Centers may charge an administration fee for managing the investor&#39;s investment.  

  	If the foreign national investor&#39;s petition is approved, the investor and their dependents will be granted conditional permanent residence valid for two years.
