SEC charges China-based firm with fraud\n\n

  	&nbsp;

  	WASHINGTON - The US&nbsp;Securities&nbsp;and Exchange Commission on Thursday charged a China-based company and the&nbsp;Chief Executive officer&nbsp;(CEO) with fraudulently misleading investors about its financial condition.

  	The SEC alleged that China&nbsp;MediaExpress, a company providing television&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;services on buses, began falsely reporting significant increases in its business operations, financial condition and profits almost immediately upon becoming a US publicly-traded company in October 2009.

  	The SEC also said that the company falsely stated in public filings which the company&#39;s chairman and CEO Zheng Cheng signed and attested to their accuracy.

  	&quot;China MediaExpress and Zheng falsely reported whopping increases in its cash balances and deceptively raised money from stock sales. Today&#39;s action demonstrates the Commission&#39;s commitment to policing financial fraud in the US markets,&quot; said Antonia Chion, Associate Director in the SEC&#39;s Division of Enforcement.

  	The SEC has filed fraud cases against more than 65 foreign issuers or executives and deregistered the securities of more than 50 companies, according to the SEC&#39;s Cross-Border Working Group that focuses on companies with substantial foreign operations that are publicly traded in the United States.
