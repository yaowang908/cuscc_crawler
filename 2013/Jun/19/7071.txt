Snowden's future hangs in the balance\n\n

  	&nbsp;

  	The fate of former US government contractor and NSA whistle-blower Edward&nbsp;Snowden&nbsp;is still hanging in the balance, analysts said on Thursday.

  	Huang Feng, an expert on international criminal law with&nbsp;Beijing&nbsp;Normal University, said that based on an evaluation of Snowden&#39;s current status, it is still difficult to predict the final outcome for him.

  	&quot;He can stay in&nbsp;Hong Kong, or head to another place that accepts him,&quot; Huang said. &quot;It depends on his attitude and the place in which he is seeking political asylum.&quot;

  	Iceland confirmed on Wednesday that several ministry officials had held informal discussions with Snowden&#39;s intermediary on the possibility of asylum.

  	Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson said during a visit to Stockholm that Snowden would need to be in Iceland in order to apply for asylum.

  	&quot;Since he&#39;s not in the country it&#39;s not for me to comment on presently,&quot; Gunnlaugsson was quoted by AFP as saying.

  	In an interview with British newspaper The Guardian last week, Snowden described Iceland as a country that shared his values, but he also expressed concerns over Iceland extraditing him to the United States under pressure from Washington.
