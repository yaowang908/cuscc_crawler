   Despite China&#39;s slowing economic growth, the retail industry in the world&#39;s second-largest economy will maintain sustainable growth in the medium and long term, commerce officials said on Thursday.

   Meanwhile, the industry is undergoing a transformation and the government will make more efforts to enhance its quality and efficiency and to optimize its structure.

   &quot;Following the restructuring process of the economic growth model, the improvement of the consumption structure, the advancing urbanization, and especially the development of e-commerce, China&#39;s retail industry in the remainder of the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) will keep steady growth,&quot; Wang Desheng, deputy director of the department of circulation industry development at the Ministry of Commerce, told a news conference on Thursday.

   Guo Geping, president of the China Chain Store &amp; Franchise Association, echoed that view and said that the country&#39;s retail industry will maintain &quot;sustainable and rigid&quot; growth in the medium and long term, driven by a huge market.

   &quot;The future development of the industry will focus on innovation, structural optimization and enhancements in quality and efficiency,&quot; Wang said. &quot;The retail industry will see faster transformation and upgrading, including the integration of online and offline retail channels, mergers across regions and brand building.&quot;

   China&#39;s retail sales increased 12.6 percent year-on-year from January to May, a pace slower than the 14.3 percent growth seen in 2012 or the 17.1 percent increase in 2011, according to the ministry.

   The central government outlined that the country&#39;s retail sales will grow 15 percent annually to 32 trillion yuan ($5.22 trillion) in 2015 from 18.12 trillion yuan in 2011.

   Meanwhile, the new leadership of the world&#39;s second-largest economy vowed to shift economic growth from the export- and investment-driven model to a consumption-supported one, which is more sustainable, and is showing more tolerance for the economic slowdown. China&#39;s GDP growth eased to 7.7 percent in the first quarter of the year from 7.9 percent in the last quarter of 2012.
