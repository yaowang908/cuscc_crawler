S.E.C. Files Civil Case Against Steven Cohen of SAC\n\n

  	Federal regulators filed a civil action against Steven A. Cohen on Friday, blaming the billionaire hedge fund manager for &ldquo;failing to supervise&rdquo; employees accused of insider trading.   

  	The action, filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, delivers a serious blow to Mr. Cohen, the founder of SAC Capital Advisors. The agency is seeking to bar Mr. Cohen from overseeing investor funds, a death knell to a hedge fund manager.  

  	
  	&ldquo;Hedge fund managers are responsible for exercising appropriate supervision over their employees to ensure that their firms comply with the securities laws,&rdquo; Andrew J. Ceresney, co-head of the S.E.C.&rsquo;s enforcement division, said in a statement. &ldquo;After learning about red flags indicating potential insider trading by his employees, Steven Cohen allegedly failed to follow up to prevent violations of the law.&rdquo;Yet the order, filed as an S.E.C. administrative proceeding rather than lawsuit, stops short of accusing him of fraud. Instead, the S.E.C.&rsquo;s action focused on a breakdown in controls at the fund, once one of Wall Street&rsquo;s best performers.  

  	The action comes several months after SAC agreed to settle charges with the S.E.C., paying a record $615 million. It also comes as federal prosecutors and theF.B.I.&nbsp;continue to investigate the fund.  

  	In a statement, a spokesman for SAC argued that the S.E.C.&rsquo;s case &ldquo;has no merit,&rdquo; adding that Mr. Cohen &ldquo;acted appropriately at all times and will fight this charge vigorously.&rdquo;
