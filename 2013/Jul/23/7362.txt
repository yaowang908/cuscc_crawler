Southwest Airlines Plane's Nose Gear Collapses During Landing at La Guardia\n\n

  	The landing gear of a Southwest Airlines LUV &nbsp;+0.18%   jet collapsed after it landed at New York&#39;s La Guardia Airport Monday evening, injuring more than 10 people onboard and temporarily closing one of the nation&#39;s busiest airports, authorities said.

  	The Boeing BA &nbsp;+1.00%   737, with 149 people on board including the crew, had just landed at La Guardia around 5:40 p.m. when the nose gear failed, authorities said. It was landing after a roughly two-hour flight from Nashville International Airport, authorities said.

  	Six passengers and at least three crew members were transported to a local hospital for back and neck pain, and four were treated at the scene, said a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport. Four other passengers suffered anxiety attacks. Authorities said the plane didn&#39;t catch on fire.

  	Officials couldn&#39;t say Monday evening precisely when the nose gear failed. The aircraft touched down within the first 1,000 feet of the runway, La Guardia General Manager Thomas Bosco said, and skidded off the runway into a grassy area about halfway down its 7,000-foot length.

  	A National Transportation Safety Board investigator was surveying the damage on the runway Monday night. Officials hoped to reopen the runway Tuesday morning.
