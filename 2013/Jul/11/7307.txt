  	&nbsp;

  	NEW YORK - An original&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;computer from 1976 has sold at auction for nearly $388,000.

  	Known as the Apple 1, it was one of the first Apple computers ever built.

  	It sold Monday for $387,750 at a Christie&#39;s online-only auction. Bolaffi, an Italian collections company, says in a statement that it bought the computer. The seller was a retired school psychologist from Sacramento, Calif.

  	Vintage Apple products have become a hot item since Steve Jobs&#39; death in October 2011. Jobs joined forces with Steve Wozniak to build computer prototypes in a California garage, and Wozniak built the Apple 1.
