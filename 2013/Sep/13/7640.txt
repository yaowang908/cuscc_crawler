The Song of the Earth Twilight of the Himalayas Concert at Lincoln Center on Sept 22, 2013\n\n

  	Dear friends,  

  	&nbsp;

  	Fall greetings! As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, Harmonia Holdings and Overseas China Education Foundation (OCEF   http://ocef.org/english ) sincerely request your presence on Sept 22, 2013 for a concert at Lincoln Center&rsquo;s Avery Fisher Hall presenting the works of Chinese composer, Xiaogang Ye ( http://lc.lincolncenter.org/shows/208172?show_date=2013-09-22%2015:00:00 ).  

  	&nbsp;

  	Mr. Ye, regarded as the &ldquo;Chinese Bach&rdquo;, is one of the most renowned composers in contemporary China with works ranging from classical symphonies to folk music to film scores. His piano concerto,  Starry Sky , performed by Lang Lang was a highlight of the opening ceremony at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. &nbsp;Ye, together with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, will kick-off the fall 2013 concert season at the Lincoln Center with his three most representative works,  Twilight of the Himalayas  (2012-13),  The Last Paradise for Violin and Orchestra  (1993), and  The Song of the Earth  (2005).  Twilight of the Himalayas  incorporates characteristics of music from ethnic minorities in China and explores the theme of enduring cultural ties and friendship between Tibet and Han China.  The Last Paradise  takes its inspiration from life in the countryside of contemporary China and experiments with the sounds of western orchestral instruments. The concert will be closed by  The Song of the Earth , a showcase of traditional Chinese culture interweaving classical Chinese poetry, Chinese opera, and elements of modern western music.  OCEF is proud to be a sponsor of this concert and present the music of one of China&rsquo;s finest composers on such a world-class stage. All of our volunteers are working hard in preparation for the event. We look forward to having you share in this auditory feast!
