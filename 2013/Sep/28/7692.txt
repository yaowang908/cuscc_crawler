China to Ease Controls on Yuan Investment in Pilot Zone\n\n

  	China&nbsp;will allow trial convertibility of the yuan under the capital account in a free-trade zone being established in&nbsp;Shanghai, part of efforts to boost the currency&rsquo;s role in global trade and investment.

  	Authorities will allow &ldquo;interest-rate liberalization, and cross-border use of the currency, as long as the risk is controlled,&rdquo; according to astatement&nbsp;posted on the government website today. Chinese lenders will be able to conduct offshore business and qualified foreign financial institutions can set up banks, according to the statement, which didn&rsquo;t give a timetable for the plans.

  	The move underscores Premier&nbsp;Li Keqiang&rsquo;s pledge to open the economy to more market forces and reduce the role of the government at a time when growth is forecast to be the slowest in 23 years. The yuan was the world&rsquo;s ninth most-traded currency in April, with transactions averaging $120 billion a day, from $34 billion three years earlier, the&nbsp;Bank for International Settlements&nbsp;said this month, citing survey findings.

  	&ldquo;The yuan convertibility trial in Shanghai will be a big leap forward in China&rsquo;s financial reforms,&rdquo; said Banny Lam, the Hong Kong-based co-head of research at Agricultural Bank of China International Securities Ltd., a unit of China&rsquo;s third-largest lender. &ldquo;It shows that Premier Li is determined to continue with reforms to upgrade the economy. The next step is to see what lies in the details for the&nbsp;yuan&nbsp;experiment.&rdquo;

  	The 29 square-kilometer free-trade zone located on the eastern outskirts of Shanghai will set up an adaptive foreign-exchange management system to facilitate trade and investment, and allow eligible Chinese banks in the zone to do offshore business, according to the statement.

  	China&rsquo;s State Council signaled May 6 that it would propose a plan this year on capital-account convertibility. The nation should further widen the yuan&rsquo;s trading band and increase the currency&rsquo;s flexibility, according to an article in the People&rsquo;s Daily published Aug. 28 by Wang Yu, an official in the central bank&rsquo;s research bureau.
