Gas prices rise again as Syria worries boosts oil \n\n

  	The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the United States rose in the last two weeks, reversing four weeks of declines as crude oil advanced, according to the Lundberg survey released on Sunday.&nbsp;

  	Gasoline prices rose 2.61 cents per gallon, bringing the average cost to $3.5847 on Sept. 6, up from $3.5596 on Aug. 23. The average price was about 25 cents lower than a year earlier, based on a survey of about 2,500 retail stations in the 48 contiguous states.&nbsp;

  	Trilby Lundberg, editor of the Lundberg survey, said the rise came alongside a spike in the price of crude oil, which has jumped on the threat of a Western-led military strike against Syria, which could tighten Middle Eastern oil supplies.&nbsp;

  	U.S. crude futures are up 3.9 percent over the past two weeks while Brent crude is up 4.6 percent. On Friday, crude rose 2 percent to settle at $110.53.&nbsp;

  	While Lundberg said crude could continue to rise if military action was taken, that could be partially offset by &quot;very aggressive&quot; production.&nbsp;

  	&quot;Supplies are more than sufficient to meet demand,&quot; she said. &quot;Despite all the up factors, we may see a return to prices falling over the next two weeks or beyond. If oil slips, it is very unlikely that gas will continue rising.&quot;&nbsp;

  	The cheapest gasoline in the states surveyed was in Tucson, Arizona, at $3.27 per gallon, while the most expensive was in Chicago, where it cost $3.92 per gallon.&nbsp;
