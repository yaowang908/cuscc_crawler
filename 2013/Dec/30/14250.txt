Treasury Yield Curve Reaches Widest Since 2011 on Economy Wagers\n\n

  	Republished from Bloomberg by Editors: Greg Storey, Dec 30, 2013

  	The difference between the yields on Treasury two- and 10-year notes touched the widest level in more than two years as an improving U.S. economy bolstered speculation the Federal Reserve will end bond purchases in 2014.

  	U.S. government securities fluctuated, heading for their first annual loss since 2009, before a report projected to show pending home sales increased in November. Data tomorrow is forecast to show consumer confidence rose in December. U.S. employers added 190,000 workers this month after hiring 203,000 in November, economists said a report next week may show.

  	&ldquo;We expect the yield curve to remain steep,&rdquo; said Eric Oynoyan, a fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London, referring to a chart plotting rates on bonds of varying maturities. &ldquo;The yield on 10-year notes will probably hold in the current range until the next nonfarm-payrolls report.&rdquo;

  	The 10-year yield rose as much as one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.01 percent before trading at 2.98 percent, down two basis points, at 8:46 a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It climbed to 3.02 percent on Dec. 27, the highest since July 2011. The price of the 2.75 percent note maturing in November 2023 rose 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 98. The yield has advanced from 1.76 percent at the end of 2012.

  	The extra yield on the benchmark securities over two-year note yields increased as much as two basis points to 263 basis points, the widest since July 22, 2011, before slipping to 260 basis points.

  	The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association recommends U.S. Treasuries trading close tomorrow at 2 p.m. in New York and remain shut on Jan. 1.

  	U.S. government securities have lost 3.3 percent this year, according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY) That compares with a 0.43 percent loss by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market Sovereign Plus Index.

  	The decline in Treasuries would be the first since they posted a record 3.7 percent drop in 2009. Treasuries due in 10 years or more have slumped more than 12 percent this year, the biggest decline among the 144 government bond indexes globally compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.

  	Treasuries traded at almost the cheapest level in more than two years, based on the term premium, a model that includes expectations for interest rates, growth and inflation. The gauge was at 0.61 percent, after reaching 0.64 percent earlier today, the least expensive since May 2011, according to a Columbia Management model. The current reading is above the average of 0.21 percent over the past decade and shows investors see bonds as close to fairly valued.

  	The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield will end 2014 at 3.40 percent, according to a median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.

  	The U.S. central bank will reduce monthly asset purchases in $10 billion increments during its next seven meetings before ending the program in December 2014, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.

  	The Federal Open Market Committee said at its Dec. 17-18 gathering that it would reduce monthly buying of Treasuries by $5 billion to $40 billion, and those of mortgage-backed bonds by $5 billion to $35 billion starting in January.

  	Policy makers also said &ldquo;it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past&rdquo; their 6.5 percent unemployment-rate threshold, especially if inflation stays below the Fed&rsquo;s 2 percent target. The benchmark rate has been in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.

  	The number of contracts signed to buy previously owned homes increased 1 percent from October, according to a Bloomberg survey before the National Association of Realtors releases the data. The Institute for Supply Management will say on Jan. 2 its gauge of manufacturing was at 56.9 in December versus 57.3 in November, which was the highest in more than two years.

  	Citigroup Inc.&rsquo;s Economic Surprise Index, which measures if data surpasses or falls short of market expectations, rose to 49.4 on Dec. 26 and Dec. 27, the highest level since Oct. 2.

  	Treasury 10-year yields climbed 11 basis points last week in a sixth weekly advance.

  	Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, was $129.6 billion on Dec. 27, compared with this year&rsquo;s average of $309.6 billion.
