  	European stocks climbed in the longest winning streak in two months, bonds dropped and the dollar weakened. Turkish shares plunged and the lira fell to a record amid a government corruption probe.

  	The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SHCOMP) rose 0.7 percent at 12:30 p.m. in London, a sixth day of gains. Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index futures (SPX) were little changed. China&rsquo;s seven-day repurchase rate dropped 25 basis points to 5.08 percent and the yuan reached a 20-year high. U.S. and U.K. 10-year bond yields rose above 3 percent for the first time since September. The dollar weakened against all but two of its 16 major peers. West Texas Intermediate oil moved to within 0.3 percent of $100 a barrel.

  	Investors added $3.2 trillion to the value of global stock markets since the start of the quarter amid mounting confidence global economic growth is accelerating. U.S. initial jobless claims declined more than forecast last week, the Federal Reserve started slowing stimulus known as quantitative easing and China&rsquo;s benchmark repo rate headed for the biggest weekly drop since 2011, easing concern that a cash crunch will trigger corporate defaults.

  	&ldquo;Stock markets are indeed seeing a little Christmas rally,&rdquo; said John Plassard, vice president at Mirabaud Securities LLP in Geneva.

  	Today&rsquo;s Stoxx 600 gain brings its six-day increase to 4.8 percent, the biggest jump since July. European exchanges were closed yesterday and on Dec. 25 for the Christmas holiday. The gauge has gained 17 percent this year and is heading for its largest annual increase since 2009.

  	Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) climbed 2 percent after the wind turbine maker said it won an order from the U.S. International Personal Finance Plc lost 17 percent, extending its Dec. 24 slump after the lender of small, unsecured cash loans said the Polish Office of Consumer Protection and Competition fined its local unit 2.4 million pounds ($3.9 million) for infringing consumers&rsquo; interests.

  	Futures on the S&amp;P 500 expiring in March slipped 0.1 percent after the index gained 0.5 percent yesterday to an all-time high of 1,842.02. The gauge has climbed 29 percent this year and is on track to post its biggest annual increase since 1997.

  	Turkish shares slumped for a third day, dropping to a 17-month low, as the lira fell as much as 2.2 percent to 2.1764 per dollar. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan&rsquo;s cabinet overhaul failed to soothe investor concerns over a corruption probe that has led three ministers to resign.

  	The Shanghai Composite Index rallied 1.4 percent and the Hang Seng Index was 0.3 percent higher. Japan&rsquo;s Topix index climbed 0.8 percent, closing at its highest level since July 2008, as a weaker yen bolstered the outlook for exporter earnings. The currency earlier passed 105 against the dollar for the first time since October 2008.

  	Ten-year Treasury (USGG10YR) note yields climbed to 3 percent for the first time in three months as signs of a quickening recovery boosted speculation the Federal Reserve will keep reducing debt purchases. The yield on 10-year gilts rose 5.8 basis points to 3.03 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity German bunds jumped as much as five basis points from Dec. 23 to 1.93 percent, the highest since Oct. 17.

  	&ldquo;The Fed did decide to taper, but the amount was minimal and we have yet to see what the policy outlook will be going forward,&rdquo; said Marito Ueda, a senior managing director at currency-margin company FX Prime Corp. in Tokyo. &ldquo;Some bets on dollar gains are being unwound into year-end.&rdquo;

  	U.S. consumer confidence climbed last week to a four-month high, while initial jobless claims declined more than forecast to 338,000. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to minus 27.4 in the period ended Dec. 22, the fifth straight gain.
