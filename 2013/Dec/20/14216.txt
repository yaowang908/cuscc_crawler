Chinese Firm Seeks More Real Estate\n\n

  	Republished from the Wall Street Journal by&nbsp; Eliot Brown,&nbsp;Dec. 18, 2013

  	Since Guo Guangchang co-founded Fosun International Ltd. two decades ago, he has expanded the Shanghai company from a small pharmaceutical company to a global conglomerate with investments in Chinese real estate, mining and retailers around the world.

  	His latest target: New York property.

  	Fosun on Tuesday completed its $725 million purchase of the 60-story tower at One Chase Manhattan Plaza in Lower Manhattan.

  	The high-profile acquisition from J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. marks one of the largest purchases of U.S. property by a Chinese investor.

  	&quot;In the U.S., the priority is New York,&quot; said Mr. Guo, Fosun&#39;s chairman, in an interview in New York on Tuesday. Speaking through a Fosun translator, he added that the company was looking for other investments in office buildings, hotels and apartments, both in existing towers and in developments.

  	The Chase Manhattan Plaza deal underscores some of the challenges Fosun faces in New York. For example, the Chinese company will have a big leasing chore to fill up the tower.

  	J.P. Morgan Chase has occupied much of the building since David Rockefeller&#39;s Chase Manhattan Bank built it a half century ago. But the bank plans to move out of most of its offices there, which will vacate roughly half the tower&#39;s 2.2 million square feet of office space.

  	Mr. Guo said he thinks Fosun could fill as much as one-third of the building with Chinese companies.

  	&quot;We can bring a lot of really good Chinese companies to One Chase Manhattan,&quot; he said, speaking from a suite at the downtown Ritz Carlton, a half mile from his new building.

  	Chinese companies so far haven&#39;t been big space users in New York. For instance, Bank of China&#39;s U.S. headquarters is a relatively small, 48,000 square foot building, according to data provider CoStar Group Inc.

  	But Mr. Guo predicted that will change. He said he believes banks and other China-based companies will expand significantly in the city in coming years.

  	Fosun&#39;s purchase of Chase Manhattan Plaza is one of a number of large deals this year involving Chinese investors buying U.S. real estate.

  	Others include Greenland Holdings Group agreement to purchase of a 70% stake in Brooklyn&#39;s $5 billion Atlantic Yards project. Greenland, a state-owned company, signed a contract for that deal earlier this week.

  	Also, the family of real-estate developer Zhang Xin bought a 20% stake in the General Motors building.

  	Many real-estate experts view these purchases as the first of a wave of purchases as Chinese companies expand their global investment.

  	Mr. Guo has likened Fosun to an aspiring Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Warren Buffett&#39;s holding company. The deal for Chase Manhattan Plaza comes after the company examined U.S. property for four years, company officials said.

  	Darcy Stacom, a property sales broker at CBRE Group Inc. who advised J.P. Morgan on the deal, said Fosun was quick to respond when the building went on the block in August.

  	The Chinese company was among the first to express interest, she said. &quot;I think they said, OK, we&#39;re ready for a New York auction.&quot;

  	Fosun will face competition in the downtown office market. More than 2.5 million square feet of space is vacant at Brookfield Place&mdash;formerly the World Financial Center&mdash;in Battery Park City. In addition, two towers are nearly complete at the World Trade Center and a third may soon rise, adding millions of square feet of new space in the area.

  	Mr. Guo acknowledged the challenges in the next few years. But he pointed out that &quot;we&#39;re long-term investors,&quot; and that his company is &quot;very optimistic on the prospects of Lower Manhattan.&quot;

  	Asked when he expects to sign his first tenant at the building, he said: &quot;It won&#39;t be long.&quot;
