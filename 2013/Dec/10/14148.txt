U.S. Stocks Drop as Investors Watch Budget Talks, Fed\n\n

  	U.S. stocks fell, after the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index rose to a record, as investors watched budget negotiations in Washington and weighed the timing of any cuts to Federal Reserve stimulus.

  	The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.2 percent to 1,805.60 at 9:30 a.m. in New York.

  	&ldquo;In front of the prospect of a budget deal and the Fed&rsquo;s meeting next week, there&rsquo;s a little bit of nervousness,&rdquo; Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist with BTIG LLC in New York, said in a phone interview. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re inclined to trade sideways and I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening. We had a very strong day on Friday, so some digestion of a more than 1 percent move up is not out of the question.&rdquo;

  	The benchmark equity gauge advanced 0.2 percent yesterday to a record, extending a 1.1 percent gain on Dec. 6 after better-than-forecast jobs growth boosted confidence in the world&rsquo;s largest economy. Improving data had spurred concern that the Fed will reduce its stimulus sooner than expected.

  	Some 12 out of 35 economists surveyed by Bloomberg on Dec. 6 predicted that Fed policy makers will begin to slow the asset-buying program at their Dec. 17-18 meeting. Nine said the central bank will buy fewer bonds from its January meeting and the remaining 14 forecast that tapering will start in March.

  	Fed officials will be watching the outcome of U.S. budget talks, as Congressional negotiators have until Dec. 13 to reach a deal to trim automatic spending cuts and break a three-year stretch of failed fiscal talks in Washington.

  	Representative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, said in an interview on CNBC today that he doesn&rsquo;t like what he&rsquo;s heard about the budget deal.

  	&ldquo;There was a little more hope yesterday on that front, that we could have something positive out of DC,&rdquo; Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a telephone interview. He helps oversee $1.9 billion.Sichel said. &ldquo;Any doubt that surfaces on that could discourage investors.&rdquo;

  	The 29-member budget conference panel was set up by the legislation that ended the 16-day government shutdown in October.

  	The S&amp;P 500 has rallied 27 percent in 2013, putting it on course for the best year since 1997. The gauge trades at 16.3 times the projected earnings of its constituents, up from a price-earnings ratio of 13.7 at the start of the year. The index has risen every December since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

  	&ldquo;You have to be a bit selective as the market gets more narrow and stocks get more expensive,&rdquo; Patrick Spencer, London-based head of U.S. equity sales at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co., said in an interview. &ldquo;Sentiment overall is still bullish. December historically has always been a good month for markets.&rdquo;

  	In China, a report from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that industrial production in the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy rose 10 percent in November from a year earlier. That fell short of the median economist projection for growth of 10.1 percent. Output increased 10.3 percent in October.

  	Five U.S. agencies are also scheduled to finish the Volcker rule, which aims to reduce the chances that banks will put federally insured depositors&rsquo; money at risk by largely banning proprietary trading.

  	New York-based banks JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and their industry allies have contested the proposed rule for more than three years. The final version will curb some trading at Wall Street&rsquo;s biggest banks and chief executive officers won&rsquo;t be personally responsible for ensuring compliance, according to a draft of the final rule.
