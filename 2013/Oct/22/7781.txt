U.S. Stock Futures Rise as Jobs Data Spur Stimulus Bets\n\n

  	Republished from Bloomberg Oringated By Inyoung Hwang &amp; Whitney Kisling - Oct 22, 2013&nbsp;

  	U.S. stock futures rose, indicating the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index will extend a record, as weaker-than-forecast hiring in September fueled speculation the Federal Reserve will delay trimming monetary stimulus.

  	Netflix Inc. (NFLX) surged 9.3 percent after reporting quarterly results that beat analyst projections. Transocean Ltd. jumped 4.3 percent after S&amp;P said it will replace Dell Inc. in the S&amp;P 500 Index. Coach Inc. slid 1.3 percent after posting revenue that missed estimates.

  	S&amp;P 500 futures expiring in December added 0.3 percent to 1,743.70 at 8:49 a.m. in New York after the gauge closed at a record yesterday. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 45 points, or 0.3 percent, to 15,367 today.

  	&ldquo;Overall the number was disappointing and raises concerns about the strength of the labor market going into the shutdown,&rdquo; said Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management which oversees $180 billion. &ldquo;Equities are rallying because this delays the time frame for tapering while still indicating tepid economic growth.&rdquo;

  	Payrolls climbed by 148,000 last month, less than the 180,000 projected by economists in a Bloomberg survey, indicating the U.S. economy had little momentum leading up to the federal government shutdown. The jobless rate fell to an almost five-year low.

  	Progress in the labor market depends on how quickly the world&rsquo;s largest economy can bounce back from the loss of business caused by the 16-day closure. The budget dispute weighed on fourth-quarter growth and will prompt Fed policy makers to wait until March before starting to scale back the $85 billion of monthly bond purchases, a Bloomberg survey showed last week.

  	The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) has advanced 22 percent this year, fueled by the unprecedented stimulus and better-than-estimated corporate earnings. Analysts have raised their forecasts for profits in the third quarter, predicting an average increase of 2.5 percent for all companies in the gauge, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 1.7 percent projection at the beginning of the month.

  	Earnings at the 130 companies that have reported so far grew 5.3 percent, while sales gained 1.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Some 73 percent of the companies have topped analysts&rsquo; profit estimates, while 53 percent have beaten on sales.

  	The S&amp;P 500 will rise past 1,800 as earnings and the U.S. economy improve, Michael Shaoul, the chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based Marketfield Asset Management LLC, told Bloomberg TV.

  	&ldquo;We feel pretty good about equities,&rdquo; said Shaoul in an interview from New York. &ldquo;Corporate earnings point to a re-accelerating domestic economy. 1,800 is attainable.&rdquo; He did not specify a time frame.

  	Netflix, which has advanced the most on the S&amp;P 500 this year, surged 9.3 percent to $388.07. Subscriber growth at its Web-based streaming service surpassed both analysts&rsquo; expectations and the premium cable-TV network HBO in the U.S., driven by original shows such as the prison series &ldquo;Orange Is the New Black.&rdquo;

  	The world&rsquo;s largest online subscription-streaming service said yesterday after markets closed that third-quarter profit increased fourfold to 52 cents a share, beating the 47-cent average of 27 analysts&rsquo; estimates.

  	Transocean jumped 4.3 percent to $48.58. The offshore drilling contractor will replace Dell in the S&amp;P 500, the index provider said in a statement late yesterday. Revisions in the benchmark&rsquo;s composition prompt some money managers to shift holdings to match the equity index.

  	VMware Inc. surged 10 percent to $90.95 as the biggest maker of software that lets computers run different operating systems reported third-quarter profit that exceeded analysts&rsquo; projections.

  	Travelers Cos. (TRV) advanced 2 percent to $88.50. The lone property-casualty insurer in the Dow average posted third-quarter profit that beat estimates as Chief Executive Officer Jay Fishman increased rates for coverage.

  	Whirlpool Corp. climbed 6.5 percent to $139.50. The world&rsquo;s largest appliance maker lifted its forecast for earnings this year to as much as $10.10 a share from an earlier estimate of no more than $10. That compared with the analyst estimate of $9.97.

  	Coach slid 1.3 percent to $53.50. The largest U.S. luxury handbag maker reported first-quarter sales of $1.15 billion, falling short of analysts&rsquo; estimates of $1.19 billion.

  	&nbsp; Forest Oil Corp. (FST) lost 4.9 percent to $5.20. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its recommendation on the Denver-based energy company to sell from neutral, citing limited future gains from its holdings in the Eagle Ford region, and its unattractive valuation relative to its peers.
