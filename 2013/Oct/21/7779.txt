Home Sales Fell 1.9% in September\n\n

  	WASHINGTON&mdash;Sales of previously owned homes eased in September, the latest indication that rising mortgage rates are causing the housing market to cool after hitting four-year highs this summer.

  	Existing-home sales in September slipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.29 million, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. The 1.9% decline appears modest, but the prior month&#39;s pace was revised down sharply to 5.39 million from the previously estimated 5.48 million. Sales now held flat in August after reaching the highest level since late 2009 in July.

  	The latest figures reflect deals that closed in September, meaning buyers made their offers a month or two earlier, when interest rates were nearing their peak levels for the year. In late August the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage reached 4.58%, according to Freddie Mac. That level was a full percentage point higher than mid-May rates.

  	With interest rates still elevated and home prices rising, it&#39;s more expensive for families to purchase a house.

  	Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the Realtors group, said the summer levels are likely a cyclical high and predicts that existing home sales in 2014 will hold flat compared to this year, which would end a four-year streak of annual increases.

  	&quot;Lower affordability will hamper home sales going forward,&quot; he said.

  	The weaker figures are consistent with other measures of the housing sector that shows a slowing due to increased interest rates. The September data, however, don&#39;t fully reflect several important developments for the housing market in recent weeks.

  	Interest rates have eased more than a quarter percentage point during the past month after the Federal Reserve announced on Sept. 18 that it wouldn&#39;t be lowering its amount of monthly bond purchases.

  	&quot;Lower interest rates compliments of an accommodative Fed will help increase affordability and help resume the housing recovery, which has been a key source of strength for the overall economy,&quot; said Sterne Agee Chief Economist Lindsey M. Piegza.

  	The September home sales would have come well before a government shutdown and debt-ceiling fight weighed on the minds of many consumers. Mr. Yun said the Washington gridlock could have &quot;negatively impact&quot; October closings, but the degree is difficult to measure.

  	Uncertainty over the debt ceiling may have made some would-be buyers skittish, but moderating interest rates could entice shoppers back into the market.

  	Overall, existing home sales are 10.7% higher than a year earlier. However, that year-over-year gain is the smallest since the spring.

  	The latest data showed prices also continued to rise, but a slower pace than in previous months. The median price of an existing home was $199,200, up 11.7% from a year earlier.

  	The gain partially reflects increasing sales for homes priced at $500,000 or more and declining sales for properties costing less than $100,000.

  	Inventories held flat from a month earlier at 2.21 million at the end of September. Compared to a year ago, inventories are up slightly, the first year-over-year gain in 2&frac12; years. The inventory represents a 5-month supply at the current sales pace.

  	&quot;Limited inventory and fewer distressed sales are helping to keep upward pressure on house prices,&quot; said J.P. Morgan Chase economist Daniel Silver.
