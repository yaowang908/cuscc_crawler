Fed, Profits Push the Dow to 16000\n\n

  	Republished from The Wall Street Journal by Alexandra Scaggs, Serena Ng and Kate Linebaugh Nov. 21, 2013

  	The Dow industrials vaulted past another milestone as stocks closed above 16000 for the first time, extending a record run fueled by optimism for a recovering global economy and continuing low interest rates. &nbsp;

  	The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average has now set 40 all-time highs in 2013 and is up 22% for the year. The index rose 109.17 points, or 0.7%, to a new high of 16009.99 on Thursday.

  	The advance has been broad-based but strongest among those companies with consumer-focused businesses whose recent cost-cutting efforts are seen as giving them an edge on rivals.

  	Airplane manufacturer Boeing Co. is up 76% this year, and apparel company Nike Inc., which was added to the index in September, is up 51%. Only two Dow components are down this year. Caterpillar Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. have declined 8.4% and 3.9%, respectively.

  	tocks&#39; record run comes amid a steady U.S. economic recovery along with the extraordinary easy-money policies of the Federal Reserve. Many investors say the Fed&#39;s bond-buying actions are helping the economy by keeping interest rates low and making stocks look more attractive compared with bonds and other investments.

  	&quot;What&#39;s not to like? You want to be invested in stocks when the Fed is very accommodative and the economy is growing at the same time,&quot; said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at ING U.S. Investment Management, which oversees $180 billion. &quot;You have low inflation and interest rates are going to stay low for a very long time. A lot of things are going right.&quot;

  	With the latest climb, however, investors also confront uncertainties. Earnings growth has been slowing, resulting in rising valuations as stocks have rallied. The Fed, meanwhile, is widely expected in coming months to begin scaling back on the bond-market purchases it has been employing to stimulate the economy.

  	Thursday&#39;s gains came after Janet Yellen moved a step closer to becoming the next Fed leader, and a better-than-expected report on the jobs market boosted sentiment.

  	The S&amp;P 500 rose 14.48 points, or 0.81%, to close at 1795.85, and the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 47.88, or 1.22%, to 3969.15.

  	Should the Fed start to taper its stimulus measures, the stock market could be more reliant on improved profits to sustain its lofty levels.

  	On the positive side of the ledger, companies are years into efforts to make their operations leaner, which could boost profits whenever the economy finally picks up steam.

  	But lately, profit growth has been slowing.

  	In each of the three quarters this year, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies rose less than 6% from the previous year, down from double-digit increases following the financial crisis.

  	&quot;There&#39;s a disconnect between how well the market is doing and certain sectors,&quot; said Peter Andersen, portfolio manager of Congress Asset Management in Boston, which has $7.5 billion under management. &quot;Some companies are doing very well, but when you telescope out it&#39;s a mixed bag.&quot;

  	At the same time, corporate executives broadly remain cautious about growth prospects as they navigate a global economy that is showing new pockets of weakness in some emerging markets such as China&mdash;once big engines of sales growth&mdash;and a tepid outlook for consumer spending in the U.S.

  	&quot;Overall, the economic activity in the U.S. is OK,&quot; said Keith Sherin, General Electric Co. vice chairman, and chief executive of GE Capital. &quot;We wish it were a little bit better.&quot;

  	GE has been among the major Dow winners this year, with a 28% gain. GE has been buying back stock, paying out dividends and making long-sought changes such as slimming down its lending unit and improving its profitability.

  	&quot;Clearly, the stock market is having a good year as companies have shown they can grow earnings through cost control,&quot; Mr. Sherin said.

  	Companies that didn&#39;t meet profit expectations in their latest quarterly reports have been punished. On average, companies that reported profit below analyst estimates saw shares fall 2.9%, according to Morgan Stanley.

  	For example, Cisco Systems Inc. dropped 11% earlier this month after missing Wall Street forecasts for its quarterly profit.

  	Many investors shrug off the worry about mixed profit reports.

  	&quot;Fed policy has forced investors to take more risk for a level of return,&quot; said Michael Fredericks, manager of the $5.2 billion BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund.

  	Others say they are counting on corporate earnings to improve next year. Some are looking for an improved trajectory of growth from larger companies with exposure to Europe and emerging markets, or focusing more on expectations for continued growth among nimbler, small U.S. companies.

  	&quot;We think you&#39;re likely to see some further gains in the market, but much more driven by earnings growth,&quot; said Stephen Freedman, co-head of investment strategy with UBS AG Wealth Management&#39;s research group.

  	The risk is that earnings growth might not improve, raising risks for investors putting new money to work at higher prices.

  	&quot;Do I think the market is overbought? Hell yeah, the market is totally overbought,&quot; said Brian Barish, president of Cambiar Investors, which manages $8 billion. He has sold some stocks he views as pricey and bought others he sees as cheaper, including technology and energy firms. &quot;But in a bull market they tend to be overbought.&quot;
