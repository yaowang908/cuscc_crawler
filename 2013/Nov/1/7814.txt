China's 58.com Goes Public as It Seeks to Stay Ahead of Rivals\n\n

  	BEIJING&mdash;China&#39;s equivalent of Craigslist raised $187 million from U.S. investors on Thursday to help it grapple with a new reality for online China: The days of easy growth are over.

  	58.com Inc. listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYX +0.89% with plans to spend the funds to improve customer service, acquire rivals and increase marketing. The initiatives will help in its mission to outmaneuver competitors and drum up new users for the company&#39;s online classified-advertising service.

  	&quot;Our users and merchants, compared to the U.S., may be less Internet savvy,&quot; 58.com Chief Executive Jinbo Yao said in an email. &quot;However, they learn fast.&quot;

  	American depositary shares of the Beijing-based company opened 25% higher from their offer price of $17, and were up 49% in Thursday afternoon trading. The strong opening indicated that investors were greeting small and midsize Chinese Internet companies with more warmth, following skepticism stemming from questions over the accounting of a handful of Chinese companies two years ago.

  	But 58.com officials say the company has to move fast to tap users outside China&#39;s major cities and among the rising ranks of smartphone and tablet users. It has already expanded its physical presence, opening 27 offices in cities across the country, in part to teach tech-challenged merchants and buyers how to use the site.

  	The company faces the problems exemplified by one middle-aged restaurant owner in the northern Chinese province of Hebei, with the surname Wang, who reluctantly tried to use the website to hire five waitresses. &quot;Normally I advertise in the newspaper, but this time my daughter said she would help me run an ad online,&quot; Mr. Wang said. But after struggling to fill in the online form properly&mdash;his 58.com ad shows he&#39;s looking for &quot;zero&quot; waitresses&mdash;Mr. Wang said he switched to back to using newspaper ads.

  	&quot;In China it&#39;s competitive,&quot; 58.com Chief Financial Officer Zhou Hao said in an interview. &quot;If we don&#39;t go out there and educate merchants, someone else will.&quot;

  	Rivals have been active in getting technophobes to use their services. E-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. teaches vendors how to market to Internet users, including what colors to use on banner ads and how to write alluring descriptions of products. For its merchants that act as suppliers for Western companies, Alibaba provided classes to help them draft English emails and learn the etiquette of doing business in the West.

  	Search provider Baidu Inc., BIDU +0.87% sometimes known as the Google Inc. GOOG +0.21% of China, sends representatives to train advertisers. In March and April it dispatched employees to 250 cities to teach merchants how to use the company&#39;s advertising service, focused on smartphone advertising. Baidu also certifies some local businessmen in each city, who are then able to train others in the area. In the second quarter of last year, the company said it beat earnings expectations in part because of such efforts.

  	China still has room to grow online. The world&#39;s No. 2 economy had an Internet penetration rate of only 44% as of June, roughly half that of the U.S., according to government statistics. As of December, China had 564 million Internet users, up nearly 10% from the year before. That growth rate&mdash;combined with China&#39;s efforts to block foreign companies such as Google, Facebook Inc., FB +3.06% Twitter Inc. and others&mdash; has helped foster a massive domestic industry dominated by Alibaba, Baidu and chat-and-games conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY -0.73%

  	Still, that Internet-penetration growth rate compares with the 19% China posted in 2010, 29% in 2009, 42% in 2008 and 53% in 2007. In big modern cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, Internet use is approaching levels seen in the U.S. and Europe.

  	That leaves areas like Sichuan and Henan&mdash;interior provinces with a combined population of almost 175 million but with Internet penetration rates of about 30%&mdash;as enticing places to look for new users and business.

  	Mr. Yao, 58.com&#39;s CEO, founded the company in 2005 after a bad experience finding an apartment when he moved to Beijing from the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. &quot;It struck me that it was so difficult to find local service information and get things done,&quot; he said.

  	Though pricing differs across the country, the company offers one-year memberships for around 2,000 yuan, or roughly $325, that allow merchants to post ads displayed prominently on the site&#39;s landing pages. The company said it has 353,000 paying members.

  	58.com has an average of 129.7 million monthly unique users, with 39% of total traffic coming from smartphones. The company says users call merchants more often and see more pages when they use 58.com&#39;s services on their smartphone.

  	The company&#39;s app has been particularly popular with real-estate agents, said Mr. Hao, the finance chief. Many are young employees who stand outside buildings for much of the day, waiting for would-be renters to arrive, or carrying signs and trying to find prospective customers among passersby. The app helps the agents work with potential renters online&mdash;all while standing on the sidewalk, Mr. Hao said.

  	&quot;Now they have their smartphones with them all the time, it opens up the opportunity to engage our users with them in a way that&#39;s not possible on computers.&quot;
