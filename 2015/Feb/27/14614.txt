  	A girl from Huai&#39;an in Jiangsu province has her own &#39;lucky money&#39; story.

  	Her colleagues and bosses set up some groups on WeChat especially for giving and receiving &#39;lucky money&#39; among themselves for fun. She trained her eyes to spot the newly released red envelopes and clicked in the hope of receiving random &#39;lucky money&#39; from her colleagues.

  	On the Spring Festival Eve, one of her bosses said he would send a red packet with an impressive amount of money at four o&#39;clock in the morning, which attracted many of the employees to wait.

  	They waited excitedly until four while their boss was annoyingly quiet in the group. The next morning, they heard that their boss got drunk last night and went to bed at 12:00 am, four hours earlier than what he promised.

  	The boss finally sent a red envelope of 1,000 yuan ($166) to the group and some lucky employees got different amounts of the total.
