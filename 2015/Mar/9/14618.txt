  	Institutional innovation will provide a strong impetus for development, and high standardsshould be set for trade and investment, he said at the meeting on the sidelines of the ongoingNational People&#39;s Congress annual session.

  	&quot;Innovation is the most important driving force for development,&quot; Xi said, adding that Chinaneeds to break through &quot;system and mechanism barriers&quot; to innovation.

  	The president, who has been a frequent participant in panel discussions among the Shanghaidelegation to the NPC, also highlighted the need to better allocate financial resources aroundthe world to boost the economy.

  	The central government announced in December that China would dramatically expand theShanghai Free Trade Zone and set up three new zones in Guangdong and Fujian provincesand Tianjin municipality.

  	The Shanghai Free Trade Zone was set up in 2013 to liberalize regulations governingfinance, investment and trade in the area. Such moves are considered key levers forrestructuring China&#39;s economy and putting it on a more sustainable growth path.

  	Zhang Zhao&#39;an, an NPC deputy and economist in Shanghai, suggested making the negativelist－the list of sectors where foreign investment is banned or restricted－more transparent.Shanghai is set to unveil a shorter negative list in the first half of this year, according to mediareports.

  	Xi, who used to be Party chief in Shanghai, also highlighted strict regulations for high-levelofficials, amid the nation&#39;s sweeping anti-graft campaign.

  	This comes less than a week after top-level reformers approved Shanghai&#39;s pilot plan totoughen oversight of the business activities of officials&#39; relatives, including spouses andchildren.

  	Xi, head of the Leading Group for Overall Reform of the CPC Central Committee, asked thecity to carry out the plan in a stable manner and produce experience that could be usedelsewhere.

  	Ying Yong, Shanghai deputy Party secretary, said the involvement of family members incommercial concerns is likely to lead corruption, and such a phenomenon is particularlycommon in developed areas. Even if these relatives run businesses legally, the public still hasconcerns about potential damage to the market and justice, said Ying, who is also an NPCdeputy.
