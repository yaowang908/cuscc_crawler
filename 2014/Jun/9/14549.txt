Lloyds Sets Price Range for TSB Unit Below Book Value\n\n

  	&nbsp;From&nbsp; nytimesï¼šLONDON &ndash; The&nbsp;Lloyds Banking Gro up&nbsp; announced on Monday the price range for the initial public offering of its TSB Banking Group unit, one that is below what analysts think is the book value of the business. 

  	&nbsp; 

  	The price range has been set at 2.20 pounds to 2.90 pounds, Lloyds said. At the midpoint of the price range, TSB&rsquo;s market capitalization would be about &pound;1.28 billion, or about $2.15 billion. 

  	Analysts have said TSB, as a stand-alone entity, would have a book value of roughly &pound;1.5 billion. 

  	TSB has about 4.5 million retail customers and would be the seventh-largest retail bank in Britain after the offering. 

  	A below book-value pricing wasn&rsquo;t a surprise as the white-hot market for initial public offerings in London has appeared to cool somewhat in recent weeks. 

  	Fat Face, a British retailer, pulled its expected I.P.O. last month, and Saga, a travel and insurance provider that markets to people older than 50, has traded below its offer price in recent weeks. 

  	Lloyds, which is partly owned by the British government, must divest itself of the TSB network of 631 branches by the end of 2015 under the terms of its government bailout during the financial crisis. 

  	The bank intends to initially sell about 25 percent of TSB&rsquo;s shares, including an incentive for retail investors to buy stock, and will sell its remaining stake in the unit by the end of 2015. The pricing is expected to be finalized later this month. 

  	Lloyds, which reintroduced the TSB brand last year as part of its effort to spin off the unit, has spent roughly &pound;1.6 billion to carve out the business. 

  	The European competition authorities, which required Lloyds to divest itself of the branch network as part of its &pound;17 billion bailout, see the breakup as a way to increase consumer choice in the British banking sector.
