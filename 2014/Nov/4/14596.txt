Alibaba's first earnings to test mettle, investor enthusiasm\n\n

  	According to Chinadaily : Alibaba Group Holding Ltd&#39;s first full quarterly report card to Wall Street investors on Tuesdaywill be scrutinized by the hopeful seeking validation for lofty stock price targets and studied bythe few skeptics searching for inauspicious signs.Coming off Alibaba&#39;s record-breaking $25 billion IPO inSeptember, the company&#39;s shares have remained 45percent above their debut price. Just about everybrokerage has rated the e-commerce giant a buy, takingcomfort in the group&#39;s dominant position in a $450 billionChinese market.

  	Investors have been all too eager to overlook a structurethat critics say allows its management extraordinarydecision-making power, potentially to the detriment ofshareholders. They have also mostly withheld judgment onhow advertising spending and sales commission fees,where Alibaba makes the lion&#39;s share of its money, arebeing affected in a slowing Chinese economy.

  	Instead, their focus is on Alibaba&#39;s profit margins, amongthe fattest in the global e-commerce industry and faroutstripping those of loss-making Amazon. Reflecting thepositive sentiment, the firm&#39;s forward price-to-earningsratio is pegged at more than 45.

  	&quot;The stock is now trading at a pretty high multiple, and in order to justify that, they need toshow really strong results out of the gate,&quot; said Wedbush Securities&#39; Gil Luria.

  	While major shareholder Yahoo Inc has included basic figures such as Alibaba&#39;s revenue andearnings per share every quarter, Tuesday marks the Chinese company&#39;s first full-fledgedresults release.

  	Net profit is expected at $1.17 billion in the quarter ended September, according to aThomson Reuters SmartEstimate poll of 21 analysts. Fully reported earnings per share areforecast to be at 36 cents, based on a poll of 25 analysts.

  	Wall Street will keep its eye peeled for any sign that runaway growth is waning.

  	While Alibaba can depend on its still-growing home market for years to come, expandinginternationally will be difficult given its marginal presence in foreign markets, which now yieldjust about 9 percent of overall sales, analysts say.

  	At home, JD.com Inc is chipping away at its market share, using an Amazon-like model whereit builds its own warehouses and handles logistics. Alibaba&#39;s marketplace model, relinquishingcontrol over logistics, may hurt it in the long run by putting product quality at risk.

  	&quot;JD.com&#39;s efforts to compete with Alibaba through a vertically integrated approach remind usa bit of the eBay-Amazon battle,&quot; RBC&#39;s Mark Mahaney wrote in an Oct 29 note.

  	There are &quot;disadvantages in terms of limited control over customer service and fulfilment,logistics, and delivery&quot;, he said.

  	Expanding the empire

  	Alibaba, which operates China&#39;s largest Internet shopping destination Taobao and retail siteTmall.com, is nearly unknown to most Americans but is ubiquitous in China.

  	The Chinese e-commerce company, founded by former schoolteacher Jack Ma in hisapartment in 1999, has designs of expanding beyond its commerce roots.

  	The company has spent significant sums acquiring firms and startups in some of the fastest-growing mobile markets, delving into services such as messaging and digital content. It haseven made select acquisitions in the United States, amid persistent speculation that Alibabais preparing some sort of move against Amazon.

  	It is also making moves to more closely resemble its US peer, including establishing a cloudservice that provides storage and computing (Aliyun), and a budding online video service.

  	Alibaba&#39;s dominance of Chinese commerce has piqued interest in America. Apple Inc CEOTim Cook has said he would be happy to work with Ma. The Alibaba executive chairmancalled on Hollywood studios all of last week, after headlining a major technology conferencein Laguna Beach.

  	Ultimately, what investors want to see is topline growth. Alibaba is expected to post revenueof about $2.7 billion in the September quarter, up about 52 percent from a previously reported$1.78 billion a year earlier. It is expected to have profit margins of more than 40 percentduring the period.

  	&quot;There&#39;s going to be scrutiny of every number,&quot; Wedbush Securities&#39; Luria said.
