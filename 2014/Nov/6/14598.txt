  		China plans to build a 100-bed medical centre in Liberia to combat Ebola, officials announced on Thursday, after criticism that&nbsp;the country is not doing enough to fight the disease.

  		China will send 1,000 aid workers to Ebola-affected areas &ldquo;in the months to come&rdquo;, and has already sent 252 people to the three hardest-hit countries &ndash; Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone &ndash; since the deadly virus broke out in March, the official newswire Xinhua&nbsp;reported&nbsp;on Wednesday.

  		Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei elaborated on the announcement at a regular press conference on Thursday afternoon. &ldquo;In Liberia, we will build a 100-bed medical centre,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On 9 November, 160 medical workers will set off for&nbsp;Liberia.&rdquo; He added that 320 additional workers would arrive at the centre at a later date.

  		&ldquo;All the construction materials, construction workers and medical workers are in place,&rdquo; he said. The centre is scheduled to open in 30 days.

  		Hong said: &ldquo;Many countries have evacuated their diplomatic personnel, aid workers and enterprises from affected areas. However, there are still several thousand Chinese people working there.&rdquo;

  		Hong&rsquo;s comments partially contradict earlier reports that scores of Chinese workers have fled Ebola-affected countries since the spring. According to the Wall Street Journal, the state-backed China Henan International Cooperation Grouppulled most of its workers from an $80m road-building project&nbsp;in Liberia in August. China&rsquo;s commerce ministry estimated then that 20,000 Chinese people lived in affected countries; since then, the number may have halved.

  		Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank,&nbsp;told reporters this week&nbsp;that &ldquo;many countries in Asia who could help simply are not [helping], especially when it comes to sending health workers&rdquo;. He did not mention China by name.

  		Last month Brett Rierson, the World Food Programme&rsquo;s China representative, urged&nbsp;China&nbsp;to do more to fight the disease. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s been willing to do anything big yet,&rdquo; he said.

  		The US secretary of state, John Kerry,&nbsp;said last month&nbsp;that the US and China, despite their many disagreements, hoped to work together to curb the virus. China has sent a total of $122m (&pound;76m) to combat Ebola,&nbsp;according to the China Daily. The US has pledged more than $1bn.

  		&ldquo;China and Africa are good brothers who hold hands,&rdquo; Hong said. &ldquo;When&nbsp;Africa&nbsp;is hit by Ebola, the Chinese government and people feel like they&rsquo;re suffering, so we offer assistance to the best of our abilities. China is a developing country, but we are doing everything we can.&rdquo;
