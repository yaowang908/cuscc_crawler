  	According to washingtontimes, In what&nbsp;White House&nbsp;officials described as a &ldquo;game-changer,&rdquo;&nbsp;President&nbsp;Obama on Monday announced a new visa deal with&nbsp;China&nbsp;designed to boost both countries&rsquo; travel and tourism industries.

  	&nbsp;

  	Under the new agreement, short-term tourist and businesses visas for those traveling from the U.S. to&nbsp;China&nbsp;or vice versa will now be valid for 10 years. Previously they were valid for just one year.

  	The two nations also will begin issuing&nbsp;student&nbsp;&nbsp;visas valid for five years rather than one, officials said.

  	&ldquo;In terms of the U.S.-China&nbsp;bilateral&nbsp;relationship, this is a game-changer,&rdquo; said Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council.

  	The new visa policy aims to take advantage of&nbsp;China&rsquo;s status as the fastest-growing&nbsp;tourism&nbsp;market on earth. Administration officials said 100 million Chinese travel abroad each year, but last year only 1.8 million visited the U.S.

  	The&nbsp;White House&nbsp;says the new visa agreement will draw as many as 7.3 million Chinese&nbsp;travels&nbsp;to the U.S. over the next seven years.

  	The U.S. will begin issuing the new visas on Wednesday.

  	In a speech at the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing, Mr. Obama said Chinese President Xi Jinping was instrumental&nbsp;in finalizingthe deal.

  	&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from American&nbsp;business&nbsp;leaders about how valuable this step will be. And we&rsquo;ve worked hard to achieve this outcome because it clearly serves the mutual interest of both of our countries,&rdquo; Mr. Obama said. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m proud that during my visit to&nbsp;China, we will mark this important breakthrough, which will benefit our economies and bring our people together, and I&rsquo;m pleased that President Xi has been a partner in getting this done.&rdquo;
