U.S. Stocks Retreat as Retailers Slump Before Earnings\n\n

  	Republished from Bloomberg by&nbsp;Nick Taborek, Jan 9, 2014

  	U.S. stocks fell, after erasing an early gain, as retailers slumped while investors awaited tomorrow&rsquo;s jobs report and the start of corporate earnings season.

  	Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. (BBBY) plunged 13 percent after projecting earnings that missed analysts&rsquo; predictions, as retailers dropped 0.8 percent as a group in the S&amp;P 500. Macy&rsquo;s Inc. rallied 7.6 percent after forecasting profit that beat analysts&rsquo; estimates. J.C. Penney gained 4.8 percent after Piper Jaffray Cos. recommended buying the shares. Ford Motor Co. climbed 1.8 percent after raising its dividend 25 percent.

  	The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3 percent to 1,832.83 at 10:58 a.m. in New York, after gaining as much as 0.3 percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 59.15 points, or 0.4 percent, to 16,403.59. Trading in S&amp;P 500 stocks was 25 percent above the 30-day average at this time of day.

  	&ldquo;You could be seeing some anticipation that the jobs number tomorrow could be really high,&rdquo; Walter Todd, who oversees about $950 million as chief investment officer of Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood, South Carolina, said by phone. &ldquo;That could change the timetable for the Fed&rsquo;s ultimate exit from quantitative easing.&rdquo;

  	The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6 percent in 2014 through yesterday, after climbing 30 percent last year, the most since 1997. Three rounds of Federal Reserve stimulus have helped propel the S&amp;P 500 higher by as much as 173 percent from a 12-year low in 2009.

  	Equities slipped yesterday as minutes from the Fed&rsquo;s latest meeting fueled concern that stimulus cuts may be accelerated. Officials saw diminishing economic benefits from the central bank&rsquo;s bond-buying program, according to the minutes, which didn&rsquo;t describe a set schedule for the pace of reductions, although &ldquo;a few&rdquo; officials mentioned the need for a &ldquo;more deterministic path.&rdquo;

  	The Fed announced after the December meeting that it would begin trimming monthly bond buying by $10 billion to $75 billion this month as the U.S. economy continues to improve.

  	Data today showed applications for U.S. unemployment benefits declined by 15,000 to 330,000 in the period ended Jan. 4. The median forecast of 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected 335,000. The data can be volatile after the holidays as temporary workers are dismissed, a Labor Department spokesman said as the report was released.

  	A report from the ADP Research Institute in Roseland, New Jersey, yesterday showed companies added 238,000 workers in December, the biggest increase since November 2012. A Labor Department report tomorrow may show total payrolls rose by 196,000 last month, according to a Bloomberg survey median. That would bring the total for the year to 2.27 million, the most since 2005.

  	Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum maker, reports its quarterly results after the close of trading today. Analysts predict that companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) will increase their earnings by 9.7 percent on average this year and their sales by 3.8 percent, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

  	&ldquo;We are at a tipping point -- if not a turning point -- where markets will start to be driven by earnings per share and not price-to-earnings ratios,&rdquo; said Romain Boscher at Amundi Asset Management in Paris, which oversees about $1 trillion.

  	The equity benchmark trades at 15.5 times estimated earnings, more than the average multiple of 14.1 over the last five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

  	JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will all post their results next week.
