  	Republished from Bloomberg news, by Nick Taborek, Jan 30, 2014  

  	U.S. stocks&nbsp; rebounded, trimming the worst January loss in four years, as earnings beat estimates at companies from Facebook Inc.(FB) &nbsp;to PulteGroup Inc. and consumer spending picked up. 

  	Facebook jumped 16 percent as the world&rsquo;s largest social network said more than half its advertising revenue came from mobile devices in its last quarter. Blackstone Group LP and Under Armour Inc. also rallied after reporting earnings that beat estimates. Eight of 10 Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index industry groups rose as the government reported the economy grew 3.2 percent and spending climbed the most in three years. 

  	The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.8 percent to 1,788.27 at 11:12 a.m. in New York , rising from a two-month low. The equity benchmark lost 1 percent yesterday as the Federal Reserve decided to reduce its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion. The S&amp;P 500 was down 4 percent for the month at today&rsquo;s open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average &nbsp;added 77.48 points, or 0.5 percent, to 15,816.27 today. 

  	&ldquo;The fact we can print a quarter in which GDP growth was more than 3 percent, even though government spending &nbsp;contracted as much as it did, is unquestionably a positive,&rdquo; Dan Grenhaus , chief global strategist at BTIG LLC in New York, said by phone. &ldquo;The concerns over emerging markets &nbsp;are the dominant topic. To the extent this remains contained, the sell-off is likely to be limited.&rdquo; 

  	U.S. benchmark indexes are poised for their biggest monthly declines since May 2012 and worst January returns in four years amid turmoil in emerging markets. Investors are pulling money from exchange-traded funds that track emerging markets at the fastest rate on record, as China&rsquo;s slowing growth and cuts to central-bank stimulus sink currencies from Turkey &nbsp;to Brazil 

  	The 3.2 percent annualized gain in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter matched the median forecast in a survey of economists and followed a 4.1 percent advance in the prior three months, Commerce Department figures showed today. Growth in the second half of the year was the strongest since the six months ended in March 2012. Customer Spending, which accounts for almost 70 percent of the economy, climbed 3.3 percent, less than estimated. 

  	&nbsp;

  	Jobless claims climbed by 19,000 to 348,000 in the period ended Jan. 25, which included the Martin Luther King holiday, Labor Department data showed. The reading was the highest since mid-December. The median forecast of 55 economists was 330,000. 

  	Stocks briefly pared gains today as a report showed contracts to purchase existing homes in the U.S. fell more than forecast in December as higher borrowing costs and bad weather held back sales. The gauge of pending home sales slumped 8.7 percent, the biggest decline since May 2010, after a revised 0.3 percent drop in November that was initially reported as a gain, the National Association of Realtors said. 

  	Facebook rose 16 percent to $61.97. The social network reported that revenue jumped 63 percent to $2.59 billion in the fourth quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.35 billion. Profit of 31 cents a share exceeded the 27-cent average projection&nbsp;of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 

  	PulteGroup added 0.5 percent to $19.53. Net income increased to $220.1 million, or 57 cents a share, from $58.7 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier. That compares with a 46-cent average estimate of 19 analysts. PulteGroup has focused on increasing house prices and managing spending as rising mortgage rates cut into homebuyer demand by making purchases more expensive. The builder&rsquo;s average selling price gained 13 percent in the fourth quarter. 

  	Among other companies rallying on better-than-estimated earnings, Blackstone Group LP jumped 3.5 percent to $32 after the biggest manager of alternative assets posted a record fourth-quarter profit. Under Armour Inc. climbed 21 percent after earnings per share beat estimates by 11 percent. 

  	Harman International Industries Inc. jumped 13 percent to $98.39 and Pitney Bowes Inc. climbed 15 percent to $24.93 after both companies raised their earnings forecasts. 

  	Companies in the S&amp;P 500 &nbsp;probably increased their earnings per share by 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 and their revenue by 2.6 percent, analysts&rsquo; estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. 

  	Google Inc. gained 2.9 percent to $1,138.84 after Lenovo Group Ltd. agreed to buy the Motorola Mobility mobile-phone business from the owner of the world&rsquo;s largest search engine for $2.91 billion. The Chinese PC maker will pay $1.4 billion in cash and its own shares and $1.5 billion in a three-year promissory note, Google said in a statement &nbsp;late yesterday. 

  	Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. rallied 20 percent to $160.11 for the biggest gain in the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp; The drug&nbsp; company &nbsp;forecast 2014 profit above analysts&rsquo; estimates as fourth-quarter sales of Soliris, which treats a rare blood disease, rose 38 percent. 

  	&nbsp;

  	Visa Inc.(V)&nbsp; rose 2.2 percent to $221.85 as the debit- and credit-card network posted profit for the first quarter of its financial year that beat analysts&rsquo; estimates. The company generated net income of $2.20 a share, more than the $2.16 average projection &nbsp;in a survey. 

  	Exxon Mobil Corp. lost 1.5 percent to $93.70. The world&rsquo;s largest oil producer by market value said fourth-quarter profit dropped as it pumped less crude and natural gas from wells, and prices stagnated. 

  	More than $7 billion flowed from ETFs investing in developing-nation assets in January, the most since the securities were created, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) &nbsp;has seen its assets shrink by 11 percent, while the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF is poised for the biggest monthly redemption since the fund was started in 2005. The WisdomTree Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund (ELD) &nbsp;is on track for an eighth straight month of withdrawals. 

  	Investors accelerated redemptions after data showed Chinese manufacturing contracted and Argentina &rsquo;s unexpected devaluation of its peso dented confidence in Latin America . Surprise rate increases by central banks in Turkey and South Africa &nbsp;failed to boost their currencies, while the U.S.Federal Reserve &nbsp;opted to press on with reductions to its monetary stimulus.
