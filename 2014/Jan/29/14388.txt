ICBC Agrees to Buy 60% of Standard Bankâ€™s Markets Unit\n\n

  	Republished from Bloomberg News, by Renee Bonorchis, Jan 29, 2014  

  	Industrial&amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world&rsquo;s most profitable lender, agreed to pay about $765 million for 60 percent of&nbsp;Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK)&rsquo;s markets unit to expand in commodities and currency trading. 

  	Standard Bank, based in Johannesburg, has granted ICBC a five-year option to acquire an additional 20 percent stake in the London-based business, according to a statement yesterday. That option only starts two years after the deal is completed and if ICBC takes up the right, Standard Bank can require the Chinese lender to buy the remaining stake in the unit. 

  	The purchase will advance ICBC Chairman Jiang Jianqing&rsquo;s target of tripling the contribution of overseas earnings to 10 percent by 2016 as the bank follows corporate clients expanding abroad and seeks to tap demand for yuan-denominated goods and services. Since 2007, ICBC has spent about $7 billion on more than 10 acquisitions from South&nbsp;Africa&nbsp;to the U.S. 

  	ICBC bought a 20 percent stake in Standard Bank for $5.4 billion in 2008, making it China&rsquo;s biggest overseas purchase at the time. In 2012, the Chinese lender acquired 80 percent of Standard Bank&rsquo;s Argentine unit. Standard Bank earlier this month named former ICBC President Yang Kaisheng as deputy chairman. 

  	ICBC&rsquo;s interest in expanding in&nbsp;London&nbsp;comes after the&nbsp;Bank of England&nbsp;said in November that it&rsquo;s ready to help create a yuan-clearing bank there as the city seeks to become an offshore hub for trading the Chinese currency. 

  	Standard Bank is not looking at selling other assets to ICBC, David Munro, head of corporate and investment banking at the South African lender, told reporters in Johannesburg yesterday. The bank&rsquo;s remaining London assets will be regrouped into a new legal entity, which isn&rsquo;t for sale, he said. 

  	Standard Bank&rsquo;s global markets unit formed part of the lender&rsquo;s corporate and investment banking division. The global markets team, with some staff in London, offered the bank&rsquo;s clients trading and other services involving foreign exchange,&nbsp;interest rates, credit, equities and commodities. 

  	The sale will help Standard Bank, Africa&rsquo;s largest lender, renew its focus on its home continent as it withdraws from other&nbsp;emerging markets. The lender has been selling assets outside Africa since 2011 to raise cash for expansion in the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing region after developing&nbsp;Asia. 

  	The sale &ldquo;will lead people to possibly re-evaluate their views on Standard Bank&nbsp;South Africa&nbsp;because there will be less drag from capital tied up in London,&rdquo; Johann Scholtz, head of research at Afrifocus Securities Ltd. in&nbsp;Cape Town, said yesterday by phone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously beneficial from a profitability point of view for Standard Bank and it removes uncertainty.&rdquo;  

  	Standard Bank shares fell 3.2 percent to 118.01 rand in Johannesburg trading yesterday, compared with a 2.8 percent decline in the six-member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index. 

  	Standard Bank said the purchase price of about $765 million is based on the unit&rsquo;s net asset value of $1.41 billion at the end of June. The rand has declined 14 percent against the dollar since then. 

  	&ldquo;A foreign exchange translation reserve has built up because of the rand&rsquo;s weakness,&rdquo; Simon Ridley, chief financial officer of&nbsp;Standard Bank, said in a presentation to reporters today. &ldquo;That means a gain will be recognized on the disposal&rdquo; of about 2 billion rand ($178 million), he said.
