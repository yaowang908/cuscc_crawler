  	Republished from Bloomberg by&nbsp;Jonathan Morgan, Jan 23, 2014

  	U.S. stock futures fell, indicating that the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index may drop for the first time in three days, after a gauge of China&rsquo;s manufacturing contracted and investors analyzed corporate earnings.

  	Alcoa Inc. and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. slipped at least 1.4 percent, following European commodity producers lower. EBay Inc. added 1.9 percent after activist investor Carl Icahn proposed spinning off the company&rsquo;s PayPal unit. Netflix Inc. (NFLX) surged 17 percent as it projected customer growth that topped analysts&rsquo; estimates. Union Pacific Corp. climbed 1.5 percent as the railroad&rsquo;s profit beat forecasts.

  	S&amp;P 500 futures expiring in March fell 0.3 percent to 1,833.3 at 8:39 a.m. in New York. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 62 points, or 0.4 percent, to 16,255 today.

  	The S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.3 percent in the holiday-shortened week as investors scrutinized earnings from International Business Machines Corp. to Delta Air Lines Inc. and Coach Inc. Of the 101 index members that have posted results so far this season, 73 percent have beaten estimates for profit and 66 percent have exceeded sales projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

  	Per-share profit for companies in the benchmark probably climbed 6 percent in the fourth quarter, while sales increased 2.2 percent, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

  	Data today showed applications for U.S. unemployment benefits held near a six-week low, showing firings remain muted following the holidays. Jobless claims rose by 1,000 to 326,000 in the period ended Jan. 18, Labor Department data showed. The median forecast of 50 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected 330,000.

  	A separate release will probably show sales of previously-owned homes rose to a 4.92 million annual pace in December, from a 4.90 million rate a month earlier.

  	Federal Reserve officials scrutinize labor data to determine the timing and pace of any reductions to their stimulus. The central bank, which next meets Jan. 28-29, decided at its December meeting to start cutting its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion to $75 billion.

  	Three rounds of Fed monetary stimulus have helped the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) rise 172 percent from a 12-year low in 2009. The benchmark index jumped 30 percent to a record last year, the most since 1997. The rally has boosted equity valuations to near the highest level since 2009. The S&amp;P 500 trades at 15.6 times the estimated earnings of its members, more than the five-year average multiple of 14.1, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

  	Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, dropped 2.2 percent to $11.95. Commodity producers declined in Europe, following a retreat in prices for industrial metals after manufacturing data from China, the world&rsquo;s biggest consumer, fell below economists&rsquo; forecasts.

  	Cliffs Natural Resources, the biggest U.S. iron-ore producer, dropped 1.4 percent to $20.90.

  	Zhone Technologies Inc. tumbled 21 percent to $4.93 after the provider of network products for voice, data and video services reported fourth-quarter revenue of $32.3 million, missing an estimate for $32.5 million.

  	EBay added 1.9 percent to $55.46. The operator of the world&rsquo;s largest online-shopping site hasn&rsquo;t performed as well as it should have and a separation of PayPal, one of its faster-growing businesses, would improve value, Icahn said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. Icahn is nominating two of his employees to join the board.

  	Netflix surged 17 percent to $391.50. The world&rsquo;s largest subscription streaming service forecast customer growth ahead of analysts&rsquo; estimates and saying it may charge new users more to share accounts.

  	Netflix predicted 2.25 million new domestic subscribers this quarter. The Los Gatos, California-based company also estimated first-quarter profit of $48 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with analysts&rsquo; projections of 75 cents.

  	Union Pacific climbed 1.5 percent to $171. The biggest U.S. railroad reported fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts&rsquo; estimates after a record corn crop increased shipments of agricultural products. Shipments of automobiles and industrial products also rose.
