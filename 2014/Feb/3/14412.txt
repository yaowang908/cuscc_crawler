  	Fox network&rsquo;s Super Bowl broadcast of the Seattle Seahawks&rsquo; 43-8 win over the Dever Broncos &nbsp;drew the fifth-highest television rating for the game in the top U.S. TV markets, the network said.   

  	The three hour, 25 minute-long game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey , last night attracted an average of 47.6 percent of households in the top 56 markets, Lou D&#39;Ermilio , a spokesman for New York-based Fox, said in an e-mail. Last year&rsquo;s telecast on CBS scored an initial rating of 48.1.   

  	The annual National Football League championship is routinely the most-watched event on television, with last year&rsquo;s matchup drawing an audience &nbsp;of 108.7 million. This year&rsquo;s game pitted the Seahawks, the No. 1 defense, against the Broncos&rsquo; top-rated offense, the first time in five years the two No. 1 seeds have met for the Lombardi trophy. The 2012 game drew a record 111.3 million viewers , according to Nielsen. 

  	More complete national ratings are due later. Advertisers including at least seven automotive brands were paying an average of $4 million for 30 seconds of air time, along with as much as $2 million to produce their commercials, according to Kantar Media. Carmakers as a group were the single biggest sponsors for the third straight year. 

  	21st Century Fox Inc., parent of the network, fell 0.6 percent to $31.82 on Jan. 31 in New York. Class A shares of the company, controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch , rose 56 percent in 2013.
