World's Highest Minimum Wage on Ballot in Switzerland\n\n

  	China-U.S. Chamber of Commerce,&nbsp;By Catherine BosleyApr 13, 2014 6:00 PM ET Bloomberg News.

  	The Swiss will vote in a national referendum May 18 on whether to create a minimum wage of 22 francs ($25) per hour, or 4,000 francs a month. While about 90 percent of workers in Switzerland already earn more than that, employers say setting Switzerland&rsquo;s first national wage floor would push up salaries throughout the economy. When adjusted for currency and purchasing power, it would be the highest minimum in the world.

  	&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t pay it,&rdquo; said Eicher, standing behind the counter in her shop in Schlieren. The employee she let go earned 3,500 francs a month. Now she&rsquo;s by herself, working 10 hours a day, six days a week, and her hopes of hiring a cheaper helper would be dashed if the proposal passed.

  	&ldquo;Of course I understand about people not earning enough, but not everyone is worth 4,000 francs. Here in Switzerland we&rsquo;re already so well-off,&rdquo; she said.

  	The chief backers of the proposal are Switzerland&rsquo;s biggest trade unions, which argue that pay levels need to reflect the country&rsquo;s prices -- among the world&rsquo;s highest. A poll by researcher gfs.bern released April 11 said 52 percent of voters were likely to reject it, while Leger research firm last month found the same percentage would vote yes.
