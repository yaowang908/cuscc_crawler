Obama, Mich. Senate candidate call for higher wage\n\n

 	According to WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama is using his call for a higher minimum wage to help boost a Michigan congressman running for the Senate.

 	On Wednesday, Obama is being joined at the University of Michigan by Rep. Gary Peters. That makes Peters the first Senate candidate to embrace the president&#39;s message and the chance to appear with him before voters this year.

 	Some other Democrats have shied away from Obama amid controversy over his health care plan.

 	Obama wants to increase the hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 as part of an election-year economic agenda focused on working families. The White House says that would benefit more than 970,000 workers in Michigan.

 	Obama also plans to travel to his hometown of Chicago for two evening fundraisers benefiting the Democratic National Committee.
