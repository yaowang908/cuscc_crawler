U.S. Stocks Decline as Technology Shares Extend Selloff\n\n

  	China-U.S. Chamber of Commerce &nbsp;From Bloomberg:

  	U.S. stocks fell, after the biggest drop for the Nasdaq 100 Index in two years, as technology shares extended last week&rsquo;s selloff before the start of corporate earnings.

  	The Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index declined 0.7 percent to 1,852.59 at 3:30 p.m. in New York. The index trimmed a decline of as much as 1.3 percent after falling to within about two points of its average level over the past 50 days. The Nasdaq 100 gauge of the biggest technology stocks fell 0.3 percent, bringing its three-day drop to 3.8 percent. The gauge tumbled as much as 1.6 percent before paring the slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) slipped 101.88 points, or 0.6 percent, to 16,310.83. The Russell 2000 Index of small companies sank 1.1 percent to an almost two-month low. Trading in S&amp;P stocks was 22 percent above the 30-day average at this time of day.

  	The S&amp;P 500 rose to a record last week before trimming its weekly gain to 0.4 percent in the last two days, as the selloff in technology shares overshadowed optimism on Federal Reserve monetary stimulus.&nbsp;
