Banker Dumps Wall Street to Boost Taxes on New York Rich\n\n

  	China-U.S. Chamber of Commerce from Bloomberg: The reason Gus Christensen looks like an investment banker is that he was one until four months ago. A handshake reveals a shirt monogram over the wrist, an Omega watch and lapis cuff links he got on a JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) trip to Chile.

  	One clue to his new line of work was the Vineyard Vines tie with donkeys he wore to the Yale Club on Feb. 27. Another was his name on the program for that night&rsquo;s annual Lenox Hill Democratic Club dinner as president and benefactor.

  	&ldquo;Reactionary forces are strong,&rdquo; he told his neighbors from New York&rsquo;s affluent Upper East Side, their forks and knives clinking as they ate mushroom tart. &ldquo;But the progressive side is stronger. And both time and right are on our side.&rdquo;

  	Christensen didn&rsquo;t quit banking just to head a local political club. With investors Tom Perkins and Ken Langone comparing the battle against inequality to Nazism, the language they despise is fueling the 42-year-old&rsquo;s nascent campaign for New York State Assembly, a job that pays $79,500 a year. Money from working two decades on Wall Street will help fund his mutiny against some of its treasured principles.
